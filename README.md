# TRM
TRM assignment 
1.	Look at a website and figure out if it's real or fake
2.	Find hidden clues like cryptocurrency wallet addresses
3.	Connect the dots between different scam websites run by the same criminals
4.	Give you a report saying 'SCAM' or 'NOT_SCAM' with reasons why
5.  MATHEMATICAL METHODS implemented:
Bootstrap Resampling - Statistical validation through 1,000,000 iterations
Exponential Address Weighting - S(n) = 25 + 10(n-1)
Bayesian Confidence Inversion - Score-to-confidence mapping
Graph Theory - Network topology analysis (G = V, E)
Threshold Optimization - Grid search for optimal veto boundary (60)
Regex Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) - Address extraction patterns
Cosine Similarity - Cloaking detection (dissimilarity > 0.30)
Shannon Entropy - Domain generation detection (H(X) > 3.5)
Levenshtein Distance - Brand impersonation detection (L(a,b) ≤ 3)
Recursive Label Propagation - Contagion spreading algorithm
Entropy Minimization - Exclusive classification (H = 0)
Confidence Intervals via Percentile Bootstrap - 95% CI = [0.9999, 1.0000]
